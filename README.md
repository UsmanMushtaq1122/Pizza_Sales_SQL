# Pizza_Sales_SQL
This project aims to analyze pizza sales data to understand various business insights, such as revenue trends, popular pizza categories, customer preferences, and order patterns. The analysis will use SQL to query, aggregate, and visualize data from different tables within a relational database representing a pizza shop's sales.
